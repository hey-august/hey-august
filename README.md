## üìã About

I'm a technical writer on the Developer Experience team at [SignalWire](https://signalwire.com/). 

You can find me working on developer documentation for both [SignalWire](https://developer.signalwire.com) and [FreeSWITCH](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch-docs).

I also contribute to open-source documentation for [projects I like](#%EF%B8%8F-favorite-open-source-projects).

I use he/him **or** they/them pronouns. Both are fine!
